# learning-cuda-c
A collection of CUDA kernels I've experimented with to learn about massively parallel programming

Most of this code is poorly commented, but I learned a lot putting it together. 

The most interesting file to me is [my_first_kernel](my_first_kernel.cu). My approach to the problem was awful, however I utilized thread coarsening and local memory prior to being aware of the concepts!
